## Overview

This is a [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) widget to show my gf's work schedule. I do some web scraping to retrieve the schedule, then do some processing to shim everything into place and create the UI.

The UI is defined with Scriptable's API, which is just a wrapper around Apple's SwiftUI thing or something.
